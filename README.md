Machine learning project focused on image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The primary goal was to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes.
Data Preprocessing: Normalized images, visualized dataset characteristics.
Model Development: Built a CNN with TensorFlow and Keras, including convolutional and max-pooling layers.
Training & Evaluation: Achieved notable test accuracy; validated model on a separate test set.
Prediction & Visualization: Implemented a function to load and preprocess new images for prediction; visualized results.
